This folder contains toy graph examples often used to debug concepts presented in the paper. In particular, 
1. two_flows_debug.py debugs a simple graph to check whether the optimization with two flows returns the same 
solution as three flows, and whether a solution in the case of three flows allows a path from source to target without
breaking off at the intermediate.
